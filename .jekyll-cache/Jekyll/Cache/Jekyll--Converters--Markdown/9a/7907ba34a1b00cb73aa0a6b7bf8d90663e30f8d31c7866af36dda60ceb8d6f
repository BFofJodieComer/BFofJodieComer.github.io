<p>Begin in 1909, Hansard is a â€œsubstantially verbatimâ€ report of what is said in Parliament. Membersâ€™ words are recorded and then edited to remove repetitions and obvious mistakes, albeit without taking away from the meaning of what is said. The website Hansard has started to launch in 2010, with timely updating of the ongoing speeches in Parliament. This website provides historical printed materials in scanned versions. The public has open access to the records of debates from as far back as the early 19th century.</p>

<p>The resource in Hansard could be leveraged for many research purposes, including politics, history, linguistics, etc. In terms of political research, researchers are enabled to do empirical research by investigating the key debates around certain political-economic and socio-political issues such as Brexit and climate change. These can serve as first-hand resources representing the views of the governmental representatives. Since Hansard has been launched for over a century, researchers can dig into some historical events such as World War I and World War II as massive materials were recorded. In addition, Hansard is also applicable for exploring the features of political rhetoric. Since both houses of Lords and Commons representing different parties are involved in the parliamentary debate, there can be some typical discourses for each stance concerning different socio-political events.</p>

<p>There are two distinctive characteristics of Hansardâ€™s design rationale. The first one is its categorisation methods. On the home page, there are two main entrances for the House of Lords and Hosue of commons, contained in two side-by-side divisions. In each division, quick links such as â€œBrowse sittingsâ€, â€œFind debatesâ€, â€œFind divisionsâ€ and â€œFind MPsâ€ are provided. This setting saves researchers much time in categorising content themselves. Also, it is convenient for ordinary browsing users to get themselves familiarised with the archive structure of Hansard and the fundamental information about the parliament, instead of getting headaches in thinking about a keyword using the search bar in navigation. Secondly, its colour scheme also contributes to the division of categories. Two contrasting colours of green and red are leveraged to represent two houses, revealing their differences in identity and responsibility. Hence, users are easier to differentiate each house from its colour.</p>
