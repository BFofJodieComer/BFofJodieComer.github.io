<h3 id="background-information">Background information:</h3>

<p>Being the world‚Äôs largest transgender archive, the digital transgender archive based in the University of Victoria was offcially open in 2011. The foundation of this archive shall trace back to a conversation between <em>Aaron Devor</em> and <em>Rikki Swin</em> in 2005. The former later became the founder of the transgender archive.</p>

<p>In the wake of LGBT campaigns in North America, less attention has been put on <strong>trans, non-binary and two-spirit</strong> matieral. Therefore, the transgender archives aim at filling up the gap by concentrating on the contributions of activists and researchers who are dedicated to the betterment of groups of people corresponding to these.</p>

<p>All holdings of the Transgender Archives are accessible to the public, free of charge, for personal research, investigation, and exploration.</p>

<p>I am particularly interested in a photograph named <em>Stereoscopic Card of an All-Female Marriage: The Benedict‚Äì ‚ÄúMarried at Last‚Äù</em>. Pictured in early 20th century in Kentucky, this photograph witnessed a marriage of two females, one in wedding dress and the other in black suit. The color tone of the room‚Äôs dec√≥r is bright and colorful, setting off a happy and relaxing atmosphere.</p>

<p>Back to that era, transgender marriage was not offcially admitted in any country of the world. However, the two females dressed in ways ‚Äústandard‚Äù couples did, seeming to self-legitimatize this marriage. From their facial expressions and emotions, great harmony and happiness could be found, which demonstrates the slogan <strong>‚Äúlove is love‚Äù</strong>.</p>
