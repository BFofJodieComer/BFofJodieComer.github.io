### Background information: 

Being the world's largest transgender archive, the digital transgender archive based in the University of Victoria was offcially open in 2011. The foundation of this archive shall trace back to a conversation between *Aaron Devor* and *Rikki Swin* in 2005. The former later became the founder of the transgender archive. 

In the wake of LGBT campaigns in North America, less attention has been put on **trans, non-binary and two-spirit** matieral. Therefore, the transgender archives aim at filling up the gap by concentrating on the contributions of activists and researchers who are dedicated to the betterment of groups of people corresponding to these. 

All holdings of the Transgender Archives are accessible to the public, free of charge, for personal research, investigation, and exploration.


### Browsing the website:

The website is built in a minimalist style with blue and orange as dominant colors and clear juxtapostion in oraginzing taxonomies. The main catogries of **BROWSE** are **MAP, INSTITUTION, COLLECTION, TOPIC, GENRE, and LATEST**, which enable visitors to search information in multiple ways. To learn the background information of the archives and subjects correlated to transgender.

Despite taxonomies, the websites also leverages multimedia storytelling techniques to help visitors browse the archives, including heavy texts, pictures, icons, tutorial videos, timeline as well as maps.

I am particularly interested in a photograph named *Stereoscopic Card of an All-Female Marriage: The Benedict– "Married at Last"*. Pictured in early 20th century in Kentucky, this photograph witnessed a marriage of two females, one in wedding dress and the other in black suit. The color tone of the room's decór is bright and colorful, setting off a happy and relaxing atmosphere. 

Back to that era, transgender marriage was not offcially admitted in any country of the world. However, the two females dressed in ways "standard" couples did, seeming to self-legitimatize this marriage. From their facial expressions and emotions, great harmony and happiness could be found, which demonstrates the slogan **"love is love"**.
